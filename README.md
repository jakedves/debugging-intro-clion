# Debugging in CLion

## CLion

CLion is an IDE for editing C code, it's a lot more powerful than a traditional text editor, and includes a lot of features. For this demonstration we will only be considering some of the basic debugging tools offered in CLion, and only looking at the main.c file. To setting up CLion for the first time can be confusing, so I would suggest watching a youtube video going through it.
